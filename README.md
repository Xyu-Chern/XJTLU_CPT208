## Study experience
- The grading for 23-24 is unfriendly. My class this year was okay; you can check the Mark statistics. I'd rate the course content as UI designer and product manager level. CW's grading is unfriendly, 60-70. A good score requires extremely high-quality layout and aesthetics; please refer to the visuals of major company product launches. For the final exam, I strongly suggest you take past exam papers, do them once, and then go to the teacher to ask for answers to each question. Teacher Liyue is very patient in this regard.
